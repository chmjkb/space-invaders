The project is not finished yet, however you can already move the ship, shoot 3 bullets at a time, and watch the aliens head in your direction! Once the game is finished, a score will be shown, you will be able to change the difficulty and fight the aliens all night long! There are various other features to be implemented.
# How to install?
